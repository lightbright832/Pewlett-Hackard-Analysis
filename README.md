# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
### Purpose:
Pewlett-Hackard is expecting a large number of their employees to be retiring over the next few years. This is an exciting time for retirees but Pewlett-Hackard could be in trouble if they do not begin to look at these employees and their positions. The reason for this analysis is to determine who is up for retirment and what their position with the company is. This is important so that Pewlett-Hackard can begin to market these positions to potential applicants. This type of analysis helps with future projections because the company should never wait until they have no choice but to fill a vacant position. It is best to be ahead of the game with an analysis such as this. 
## Results

* Retiring Info by Title

The above image is of representation of the employees by title with their projected retirment dates. This is a very important table for Pewlett-Hackard because it provides a timeline for when the employees will be retiring and what their current title is. This is will help to determine what positions are coming vacant and when.

* Unique Titles

The above image is the same data from the retiring titles minus the start dates and to dates. This table is important but it does not provide as much direction as the previous image that included  a timeline. 

* Retiring Titles

With the retiring titles image it is possible to see how many positions within a particular title will be retiring soon. This sheds light on which positions have the most potential for new hires. 

* Mentorship Eligible

Lastly we get data of the employees who are eligible for mentorship. This is important for future development of the staff who will be taking these positions. 

## Summary
1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Overall there will need to be 41,380 roles filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact.
2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Currently there are 1,941 retirement-ready employees available to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. In comparison to the number of postions that are about to become available there does not appear to be an adequate number of available mentors. Based on these numbers each mentor would have to take on a minumum of 21 mentees. This is not realistic for any one person. Pewlett Hackard will more than likely need to call in reinforcement to deal with the impact of this "silver tsunami".
