# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
### Purpose:
Pewlett-Hackard is expecting a large number of their employees to be retiring over the next few years. This is an exciting time for retirees but Pewlett-Hackard could be in trouble if they do not begin to look at these employees and their positions. The reason for this analysis is to determine who is up for retirment and what their position with the company is. This is important so that Pewlett-Hackard can begin to market these positions to potential applicants. This type of analysis helps with future projections because the company should never wait until they have no choice but to fill a vacant position. It is best to be ahead of the game with an analysis such as this. 
## Results

The above image is of representation of the employees by title with their projected retirment dates. This is a very important table for Pewlett-Hackard because it provides a timeline for when the employees will be retiring and what their current title is. This is will help to determine what positions are coming vacant and when.

* Unique Titles

The above image is the same data from the retiring titles minus the start dates and to dates. This table is important but it does not provide as much direction as the previous image that included  a timeline. 

* Retiring Titles

With the retiring titles image it is possible to see how many positions within a particular title will be retiring soon. This sheds light on which positions have the most potential for new hires. 

Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
